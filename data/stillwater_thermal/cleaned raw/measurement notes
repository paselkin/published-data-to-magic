I cannot figure out the cause. Jason 			Steindorf was doing the measurements. The spikes look like what would happen 			if the Sample Rate on the SQUID controllers was turned up too high. the 			samples are:		cm006b1 (550¡-555¡)		cm010b1 (550-555)		cm012c1 (565¡)		cm036b1 (520¡?)		cm038a4 (560¡)		cm044c4 (550¡)		cm046b1 (555-560¡)		cm048b2 (565¡)		All of these samples were on the upper two trays in oven 2 and furthest from the 		controllers (-> E side of ovens) SW6: (Winter, Flo, Oven 1)dead as of 10-21 (555¡)	cm125a4	cm127a2	dead as of 10-22 (565)	cm101b2	cm117a3	cm125a4	cm127a2	cm129a2	cm131a2	wc051a1	wc053b2
